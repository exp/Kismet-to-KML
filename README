Kismet to KML converter.

Tried a few converters, wasn't impressed. Hopefully this will eventually
use polygons to display a pseudo 3d view of network coverage and whatever
other swanky advanced features Google Earth supports

HOWTO:
 Run the script with the prefix of your gps and xml files:

 mykismetrun.[net]xml
 mykismetrun.gps[xml]

 perl kismet2kml.pl mykismetrun

TODO:
-Use power levels to weight network centre
-Color networks distinctly from their neighbours
-Use KML styling to distinguish networks on highlight
-Probably a lot of other stuff I can't think of
