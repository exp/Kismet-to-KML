Kismet to KML converter.

Tried a few converters, wasn't impressed. Hopefully this will eventually
use polygons to display a pseudo 3d view of network coverage and whatever
other swanky advanced features Google Earth supports

TODO:
-Hook in XML files to provide network details
-Create a polygon with the convex hull of the network
-Move the placemark to a weighted centroid of the hull
-Probably a lot of other stuff I can't think of
